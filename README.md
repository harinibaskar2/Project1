# Project1

You will write a program to solve planning problems in Vacuum World, a grid-based en-
vironment in which some cells are dirty. Your robot must return a plan—a sequence of
actions—that moves it around the grid and vacuums all dirty cells. The robot can move in
the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) and can vacuum when on a dirty
cell. All actions have uniform cost.
You must implement two search algorithms:
• Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
• Depth-First Search (DFS)
You may use any programming language, but you may only use standard libraries.
Do not import or include any third-party packages.
